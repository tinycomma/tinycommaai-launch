        <div class="section">
            <h2>AI Compute Power for All</h2>
            <p>
                Claw Tech Ai Corporation is launching a company codenamed Tiny Comma Ai (NO AFFILIATION with comma ai or tiny corp), revolutionizing how AI and cloud services are delivered for small to medium-sized businesses. 
                Our mission is to build decentralized AI-compute factory-datacenters in 1,000 communities, offering localized,
                customer-focused cloud services that empower local economies, enhance data privacy, and provide
                high-quality, personalized support.
            </p>
            <p>
                These factory-datacenters will seed factory-university micro-villages with the mission to help feed, house, and empower humans to live, work, play, love,
                learn, and pay-it-forward for happiness, health, and selfless abundance. While the villages are a future project and company (that this new entity will have 7% ownership in), they require immediate innovations in 
                machine learning and robotics. Factory-university micro-villages will be 100-1,000 acre villages that build more villages, just as our factory-datacenters will build more factory-datacenters.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Current cloud services are highly centralized, creating issues such as latency, reduced data privacy, and
                over-reliance on a few large providers. Small to medium-sized businesses, in particular, suffer from this
                model's limitations, needing more responsive, customer-centric solutions.
            <p>
                Another issue in the autonomous driving space is the lack of focus on specific automakers. While openpilot
                and its various forks have made significant strides, comma’s current approach lacks the specificity that
                many customers desire and that is required to solve edge cases specific to different manufacturers. Currently, many users need to add support for their vehicles through the open-source
                community, which can be time-consuming and technically challenging. There is a lack of dedicated team and funding
                to specifically focus on making the best driver assistant possible for all Ford vehicles in all weather conditions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>
                We offer a decentralized, localized AI-compute infrastructure by establishing AI-compute
                factory-datacenters across the U.S. These centers not only build high-performance compute devices like
                personal computers, workstations, servers, and compute clusters but also act as community tech hubs offering local cloud
                services and creating well-paying jobs. We will be able to use excess compute
                to train models for our autonomous driving assistant and a future factory robot.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                To address the issue of lack of focus on specific automakers, we are introducing a radar detector-sized
                device that will run a Ford-specific fork of openpilot. This device will be fully compatible with openpilot
                and other forks, but focus on a seamless integration experience in Ford vehicles with world-class service and support. 
                By focusing on dedicated support for our customers and specific automakers, starting with Ford, we
                aim to provide a more streamlined and user-friendly autonomous driving solution. Seperately, we will also develop a wheeled robot with arms
                that will be able to watch and learn to navigate and do various tasks in factory environments using our autonomous driving machine learning foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
                World-class service and support is our highest priority behind innovating the best solutions possible.
